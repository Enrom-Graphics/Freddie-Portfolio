Hi. Im Freddie
I own a Web Design business and wanted learn how to code. (enromgraphics.co.za)
Use wordpress and elementor pro before but want to start going into custom build websites now.
And i have a client that needs a web app created for his business. My plan is to learn front end coding and then use Node js for the backend.
So im busy with this course "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy present bu the awesome Dr. Angela :)
Been loving it.

Have a good day
Freddie
